# Series-2-Diarylimidazoles

This repository contains everything to do with the second series conducted by Open Source Antibiotics, which is an open source drug discovery project. The focus is the discovery and development of new antibiotics, specifically the optimisation of a series of molecules discovered at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. 

Aim 1 is to alter the structures of the molecules in order to maintain potency while improving metabolic clearance.

Aim 2 is to discover the mechanism of action.

As an open source project you can be involved as a full participant. For a brief outline of what this means, take a look at [this "about" page over at Open Source Malaria](https://github.com/OpenSourceMalaria/About-StartHere-FAQ) or [read about the six laws that summarise how it all works](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cmdc.201900565).
