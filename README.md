# Series-2-Diarylimidazoles

This repository contains everything to do with the second series conducted by Open Source Antibiotics, which is an open source drug discovery project. The focus is the discovery and development of new antibiotics, specifically the optimisation of a series of molecules discovered at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. 

Aim 1 is to alter the structures of the molecules in order to maintain potency while improving metabolic clearance.

Aim 2 is to discover the mechanism of action.

To learn more about the background to the project and where we're up to, click on the Wiki tab above https://github.com/opensourceantibiotics/Series-2-Diarylimidazoles/wiki. To learn about the current needs of the project and how to get involved, click on the Issues tab, also above. All files related to the project are either within online lab notebooks (see "Sources of Data" on the wiki) or are on this page (above) in the shared file structure.

As an open source project you can be involved as a full participant. For a brief outline of what this means, take a look at [this "about" page over at Open Source Malaria](https://github.com/OpenSourceMalaria/About-StartHere-FAQ) or [read about the six laws that summarise how it all works](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cmdc.201900565).

When submitting physical samples of compounds (synthetic or isolated from natural sources), please provide the following information:
1. Source of compounds- lab book or registry numbers
2. Characterization- elemental analysis, LC-MS, other evidence of purity, spectral characterization-NMR, IR, etc
3. Prior biological characterization- if any
3. Number of steps in synthesis from initial precursor

When submitting virtual compounds generated computationally, please provide the following information:
1. List program used to generate compound(s)
2. Calculated properties of the compound(s)
3. Proposed synthesis for the compound(s) with references to support the synthetic methods
